### Looking for work! 🔎
I am currently looking for an internship oppurtunity.

As part of my PhD, it is recommended that I go on a 3-month internship to gain some experience outside of the lab.

As the research council which funds my PhD would continue to pay my stipend during this time, all I would need from a host organisation is an exciting project for me to tackle  and a little guidance along the way.

If you think you might be able to offer such an opportunity, please email me!
